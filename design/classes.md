Each class at level 3 gains a TIMENAME ability. TIMENAME has a chance to activate on each kill. Each kill that does not trigger increases the chance on kill by a small amount. After it activates, it has a cooldown of both X kills and X time.
TIMENAME lasts X (3-5?) seconds, and the effect depends on the classes of the character that activates it.
Each class should have (1-2?) things they can do to extend TIMENAME (like killed zeds to exted ZED time in KF2)
