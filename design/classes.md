# Classes
- Classes have a pool of perks associated with that class. ~= ClassPerkPool
- Players are expected - but not forced - to pick an average of 2 different classes (up to 6 max) to cover ~85% of roles.
- Each class should do ? things well by default and have ? degrees of freedom in their roles that can be improved through perks.
- Classes get more expensive to buy after the first two
- The last 4 classes max out at level 4(?) (The first milestone perk)

### Roles
- Anti-Heavy: High single-target damage potential
- Anti-Swarm: Multi-target damage potential
- Anti-Armor: Potential to either pierce armor and/or remove shells
- Ammo Economy: How careful players have to be with their ammo. Good ammo economy often means ammo regen or regain abilities.
- Crowd Control: Ability to stun, slow, or or otherwise contain enemies. Often necessary for Cautious players to not get overwhelmed.
- Survivability: Ability to take punishment. Health, Health regen, armor, dodge, etc.
- Mobility: Primarily movespeed
- Support Power: Ability to benefit teammates
- Other: Other abilities that don't fall into the above roles
- Ideal Range: Where the class is designed to engage optimally
- Ideal Aggressiveness: Playstyle that abilities and weapons cater towards. Aggressive classes will often have momentum-based abilities, while cautious classes reward dipping in and out of engagement.
 - Cautious wants Crowd Control, Aggressive wants Survivability and Support
