## Who is the faction backing the players? (The 'backing faction')
### What are examples of subgroups within the backing faction?
## Who is the faction the players are fighting against? (The 'enemy faction')
### What are examples of subgroups within the enemy faction?
### What is an example of an enemy melee swarmer?
### What is an example of an enemy melee heavy?
### What is an example of an enemy ranged fighter?
### What is an example of an enemy special unit?
## Why does the backing faction want to the players to fight the enemy faction?
## Who are the players?
## What is the currency? 
## What is the in-lore explanation for a "class", and when the player trades points to gain a level in a class, what are they doing?
## What are the weapons?
### Weapons from backing faction?
### Weapons stolen from enemy faction?
## When the player trades points to get a weapon, what are they doing?
## What is the setting that players are fighting in?
## What other advantages does this story idea have?

# Fun Police
The Fun Police conduct a raid on the last carnival in the country, because fun is a controlled substance.
## Who is the faction backing the players? (The 'backing faction')
The backing faction is The Fun Police. They are a federal agency in a comedically-oppressive state that has declared Fun illegal. The Fun Police are in charge of controlling entertainment and happiness in the police state.
### What are examples of subgroups within the backing faction?
???
## Who is the faction the players are fighting against? (The 'enemy faction')
The Greatest Show (Left) On Earth is a giant circus dedicated to resisting the Fun Police. In the comically-exaggerated setting of the game, they pursue their resistance through extreme means such as forcing euphoric drugs on civilians and compromising important infrastructure like hospitals to put on "shows".
### What are examples of subgroups within the enemy faction?
Different organizations within the circus, such as Mimes, Acrobats, Animal handlers, The Freakshow
### What is an example of an enemy melee swarmer?
Contortionists crawling on the ground upside-down
### What is an example of an enemy melee heavy?

### What is an example of an enemy ranged fighter?
A showman who throws knives
### What is an example of an enemy special unit?
Two carnies carrying a cotton candy machine and attempting to drop it on the player. When it dies, it explodes in a burst of cotton candy that entangles enemies and allies alike.
## Why does the backing faction want to the players to fight the enemy faction?
The Fun Police are ideologically opposed to The Greatest Show On Earth and want to wipe them from existance, seeing them as a threat to their way of life.
## Who are the players?
The players are policement with the Fun Police
## What is the currency? 
???
## What is the in-lore explanation for a "class", and when the player trades points to gain a level in a class, what are they doing?
???
## What are the weapons?
The weapons are a mix of weapons supplied by the police force, other government branches, and weapons stolen or 'reclaimed' from the Showmen
### Weapons from backing faction?
Being a military organization, the armaments of the Fun Police primarily consist of standard military weaponry like assault rifles, pistols, grenade launchers, and shotguns. However, their armory is augmented with purpose-build weapons such as dart guns loaded with depressants, tear gas, black ink to cover up enemies that are too colorful, and other arms dedicated to getting rid of happiness and joy.
### Weapons stolen from enemy faction?
Weapons 'liberated' from the Showmen include trick flowers that spray acidic seltzer water, an axe with a mime's amputated hand tied to it that can be used to generate a temporary wall, and modified laughing gas launchers that cause paralyzing euphoria.
## When the player trades points to get a weapon, what are they doing?
???
## What is the setting that players are fighting in?
The Fun Police are raiding the grounds of The Greatest Show On Earth, so fighting takes place in various carnival environments.
## What other advantages does this story idea have?
- The players play the part of overly-serious soldiers in a silly universe, allowing them to take the story and "cause" they're fighting for as seriously or un-seriously as they like.
- The melodramatic tone of the story and overplayed tough-guy nature of the backing faction allows for plenty of dumb one-liners and dramatic lines. "Time to bring the rain to this parade." "I'm gonna turn that clown upside-down!" "Green is not a creative color." "Went down like a lead balloon."

The players are trading the harvested genetic material for the results of "specialized research" that teaches them new techniques.
## What are the weapons?
Because the maladies are human-sized, normal weaponry (guns, bombs, etc) makes up half the arsenal. The players also have a lot of purpose-specific weaponry, like bleach sprayers, blocks of soap on a stick to function as a battlehammer, 
### Weapons from backing faction?
The hospital supplies the players with oversized medical equipment to fight the infection, such as scalpel-katanas, cannula-spears, skin-staple guns, and needles filled with botulinum toxin.
### Weapons stolen from enemy faction?
As a faction whose weapons are rooted in their own strange biology, weapons taken from the Illness largely resemble chunks of their body parts with minor modifications. Chemical sprayers that generate phlegm when in contact with biological surfaces, restricting enemies, bone-based melee weapons, and chemical-powered shotguns that release quills that stick into enemies.
## When the player trades points to get a weapon, what are they doing?
They give the genetic material to the research team, and the team gives them experimental weapons in return.
## What is the setting that players are fighting in?
The players are fighting in side the body of the gigantic alien, attempting to defend major organs.

# Time Travelling Bugs
Years after humans were wiped out by nuclear war, the cockroaches that thrived in the radioactive wastes evolved into intelligent creatures that took advantage of the leftover technology and literature to jumpstart their society and learn from the mistakes of humans. Plants grew intelligent as well, but were enslaved by the bugs. Plants have been the slaves of bugs for hundreds of years now, but with a mix of atomic bullshit and an old tree with "roots that reach to the core of earth to siphon deeply-buried tachyons left over from the big bang", the plant rebellion has sent plant soldiers back in time to wipe out humanity before they can wipe themselves out with nukes, and also cover the earth with pesticides to eradicate the pre-evolved bugs before they can become a threat. So you, the bug players, have to use stolen time travel technology to go back in time and fight the plants.

## Who is the faction backing the players? (The 'backing faction')
The players are backed by the bug military.
### What are examples of subgroups within the backing faction?
??? Different types of insects? 
## Who is the faction the players are fighting against? (The 'enemy faction')
Arboreal Abolitionists, plants that want to free their kind from bondage and destroy humanity before they can cause the nuclear war that empowered both insects and bugs.
### What are examples of subgroups within the enemy faction?
Different types of commerce plants?
### What is an example of an enemy melee swarmer?
A swarm of tiny, razor-sharp thorns that can be launched from the flower's petals.
### What is an example of an enemy melee heavy?
The flower itself, which can grow massive and crush the player with its petals.
### What is an example of an enemy ranged fighter?
A special type of pollen that can be shot from the flower's center, causing the player to hallucinate and become disoriented.
### What is an example of an enemy special unit?
A rare, giant, carnivorous flower that can swallow the player whole and then regurgitate them, leaving them weakened.
## Why does the backing faction want to the players to fight the enemy faction? They should have a reason other than "avoiding extinction".
The insects are trying to prevent the flowers from altering the timeline and creating a world where they rule supreme over all other insects.
## Who are the players? 
The players are a group of highly trained, genetically engineered insects who have been sent back in time by a secret organization of insect scientists.
## What is the currency? 
The currency is a rare, glowing substance called "nectar" that is found only on certain flowers.
## What is the in-lore explanation for a "class", and when the player trades points to gain a level in a class, what are they doing?
When the player levels up, they are essentially evolving into a new species of insect, gaining new abilities and traits.
They are using "time particles" to re-integrate into their bodies the DNA of bugs that didn't survive the fallout.
## What are the weapons? 
The weapons are a mix of natural insect abilities (such as venom or stingers) and technology provided by the secret organization. The players also have access to various tools and gadgets that they can use to aid them in their mission.
### Weapons from backing faction?  (e.g., "Tools from the Insect Scientists")
The insect scientists provide the players with high-tech gadgets such as miniature drones that can scout out areas, tiny cameras that can be used to hack security systems, and special suits that allow the players to survive in extreme environments.
### Weapons stolen from enemy faction?  (e.g., "Thorns from the Flowers")
The players can steal thorns from the flowers and use them as projectiles, or use them to create makeshift shields. They can also use the pollen to create hallucinogenic gas bombs. 
## When the player trades points to get a weapon, what are they doing? 
They are essentially trading in their genetic material for new traits and abilities. The more points they trade in, the more drastic the changes will be.
## What is the setting that players are fighting in? 
The players are fighting in different eras of history, from ancient civilizations to modern cities.
## What other advantages does this story idea have? 
- The setting allows for a wide variety of creative and bizarre enemies.
- Having humans act as a third party in the game adds potential for interesting interactions.
- The insect perspective provides a unique and fresh perspective on the world.  The players' abilities and limitations are determined by their insect physiology, which adds a layer of realism to the game.  The game can also explore themes of evolution, adaptation, and survival.  The insect perspective also allows for a lot of creative freedom in terms of level design and enemy design.  The players can fight in environments such as gardens, forests, and even inside buildings.  The enemies can be designed to take advantage of the players' insect physiology, such as using their sense of smell to track them down.

# Cosmic Cultists
The players are cultists who worship an ancient deity known as  "The Great Devourer". They are tasked with summoning this deity through feeding it human souls. The enemy faction is a group of "The Order of the Eternal Flame", effectively the illuminati, a secret society of scientists who believe that the key to eternal life lies in exploiting the souls within the Great Devourer. They seek to capture the cultists and use their knowledge to summon the deity and tear it to pieces in their quest for eternal life.

Enemies are themed after failed attempts at immortality, like ruddy clones, vampires, brains in jars, people possessed by ghosts, cyborgs
