They feel like shit.

## Enemy Breakdown
- Rioters are just basic enemies with shells and an AoE buff. Having no armor on their legs makes them interesting by having a novel weakpoint that pushes (but not forces) the player to aim in an area they normally wouldn't.
- The Rioter's unique weakpoint is only interesting because the other enemies share a weakpoint. Rulebreaking is only interesting when the rule is established
- No enemy has 100% shell coverage, meaning playing with 0 anti-shell potential is viable with skill.
- Enemies that gain strength over time
- Enemies that lose strength over time
- Enemies that gain power at low health
- Clot ability: gain movespeed when close enough to player, on cooldown
- Alpha clots have the close-range buff by default. So "a sometimes buff becomes an always buff" can be an evolution.
- Many abilities have charge-up, requiring enemies to pause and play an animation

## Respawning
When you die, you lose all your weapons except one and respawn next wave.
- + Losing all weapons except one is a great way of adding cost without being crippling.
- X Having to sit out a whole wave sucks

## Damage Mechanics
- Instant Damage
- Stagger: Effect depends on attack location and intensity. Has 3 threshholds:
  1. Interrupt: stops movement or attack for a fraction of a second
  2. Causes enemies to stumble back for just under a second. Daze if head.
  3. Causes enemies to ragdoll for a second or two.
- Panic: Cancels attacks and causes enemies to move randomly
- Daze: Full stun, often caused by headshots with perks or flashbang
- Blocking: Reduces ballistic damage, daze on perfect timing
- Ragdoll: Full stun plus knockback

## Status Effects components
- Damage over time
- Movement slow
- Forced movement (knockback, fear, wander)
- Stun
- Weakness to X
- Resistance to X
- Causes another status when it ends
- Shell damage
- Armor multiplier
- Multiplier vs Enemy type

## Elements
- Ballistic: Basic damage type, deals slight flat stagger, low armor mod
- Poison: DoT. Covers player's screen to reduce visibility.
- Fire: DoT. Chance per second for panic depending on health. High shell damage, low armor
- Sonic: Reduced instant damage, increased stagger and knockback
- Bleed: DoT
- Electric: Instant damage, chains (like AoE but with less swarm potential), deals more damage to robots
- Freeze: Full stun, more vulnerable to ballistic
- Shrink: More vulnerable to all damage, but harder to hit
- Microwave: Instant damage, increase vulnerability to ballistic in non-robotic enemies.
 

## Weapons
- Flamethrower is effectively full-auto, but has a mandatory burst at the beginning of firing to make sure that shortest-possible bursts aren't the absolute best option.

## Calldowns

Long cooldown abilities with a wide variety of effects.
Would be weird indoors. Fluff differently?
Wide variety of reload mechanics. Some are oneshot with long reload, some have "clips" that reload all at once, some have "charges" that reload one at a time.
Would be great if we could shoehorn in the same "reload" system we use for guns for the above.

What role would strategems play? Would they be a feature of a single class? Are they _meant_ to be used, or just an option?

## Respawning
When a player dies, they can be resurrected by allies.
In H1, there are infinite respawns, but a party wipe is a Full Loss.
In H2, there are limited respawns, and a party wipe triggers a full respawn.
- X This makes being the last man standing useless. Dying is often better than trying to survive and res.
