## Slots
All players get the following slots:
1. Primary weapon
2. Secondary weapon
3. Backup weapon
4. Heal tool
5. Fists? Brass Knuckles? Some innate melee.

# Misc
Melee weapons have ammo used in heavy attacks?
Ballistics have a flat chance to stumble, meaning low-damage high-rof weapons like smgs are better for stagger and worse for dps
Spears? Whips? Longer-ranged melee in general? Would want to add an interesting twist.
